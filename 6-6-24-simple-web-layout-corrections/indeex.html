          <h2>Unicorns and where to find them</h2>
          <h4>
            A thorough guide to all the known sightings of unicorns until this
            day

          <h6>
            The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since
            antiquity as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn
            projecting from its forehead. In European literature and art, the
            unicorn has for the last thousand years or so been depicted as a
            white horse- or goat-like animal with a long straight horn with
            spiralling grooves, cloven hooves, and sometimes a goat's beard. In
            the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described as an
            extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace,
            which could be captured only by a virgin. In encyclopedias, its horn
            was described as having the power to render poisoned water potable
            and to heal sickness. In medieval and Renaissance times, the tusk of
            the narwhal was sometimes sold as a unicorn horn. A bovine type of
            unicorn is thought by some scholars to have been depicted in seals
            of the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization, the interpretation
            remaining controversial. An equine form of the unicorn was mentioned
            by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various
            writers, including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, Aelian, and
            Cosmas Indicopleustes. The Bible also describes an animal, the
            re'em, which some translations render as unicorn. The unicorn
            continues to hold a place in popular culture. It is often used as a
            symbol of fantasy or rarity.
